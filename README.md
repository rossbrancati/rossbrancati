My name is Ross Brancati and I'm a PhD student in the Kinesiology department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am a member of the Musculoskeletal and Orthopedic Biomechanics Laboratory (MOBL) directed by Dr. Katherine Boyer. The aim of the MOBL group is to enhance human mobility and performance through an examination of the interacting biomechanical and neurophysiological aspects underlying human locomotion. 

My research interests include utilizing data science approaches such as artifiicial intelligence and machine learning to understand the complex behavior of human movement. I plan to use this page to host my own scripts and as a place where I can iterate on previous copies of the files. I am also hoping to release some open source material. I can be reached at ross.brancati@gmail.com or rbrancati@umass.edu.
