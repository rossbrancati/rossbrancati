Hi, Iâ€™m Ross Brancati and I'm a PhD student in the Kinesiology department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am a member of the Musculoskeletal and Orthopedic 
Biomechanics Laboratory (MOBL) directed by Dr. Katherine Boyer. The aim of the MOBL group is to enhance human mobility and performance through an examination of the 
interacting biomechanical and neurophysiological aspects underlying human locomotion. Specifically, one area of focus is on the underlying biomechanical mechanisms
of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and how the patient's biomechanics are affected from knee OA. A majority of the time, these patients will undergo a total knee arthroplasty,
also causing alterations to the mechanics of the lower extremities. 

Personally, I am interested in studying functional outcomes following a total knee arthroplasty and how the surgical procedure can be optimized to prevent patient's from 
experiencing poor outcomes. I am also interested in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, and plan to apply the concepts of AI to optimizing these outcomes.
My first idea is to use machine learning to predict patient outcomes following a total knee arthroplasty, but that is just the start. I believe that the possibilities are endless
in this application. 

I plan to use this page to host my own scripts and as a place where I can iterate on previous copies of the files. I am also hoping to release some open source material. 
I can be reached at ross.brancati@gmail.com or rbrancati@umass.edu!
